###Abstract
Modern-day cloud solutions face big security challenges. Homomorphic Encryption (HE) schemes can alleviate some of the underlying security problems by preserving the Integrity and the Confidentiality of the data and, thus, it is claimed that they can radically change the way that traditional cloud applications work. Microsoft SEAL is currently the most popular Homomorphic Encryption library, due to its ease of use and performance. The most important problem of all Fully Homomorphic Encryption schemes (FHEs) is their high processing demands and the corresponding high latency per involved computation. In this Thesis, the acceleration of one widely used such scheme is presented, included in the SEAL library, (i.e. CKKS) on a state-of-the-art Xilinx Data Accelerator Card. The presented module achieves a speedup of almost two orders of magnitude when compared with the execution of the same scheme in a modern CPU, while achieving notable results in comparison with existing GPU-based implementations in terms of both performance and/or power efficiency. This can be considered as a significant step towards porting, and thus accelerating, the most computationally intensive parts of the SEAL library to reconfigurable devices.
